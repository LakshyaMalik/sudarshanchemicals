# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Alpha Sudarshan Chemicals Website

Welcome to the repository for the Alpha Sudarshan Chemicals website - your go-to source for information about this Kota, Rajasthan-based manufacturer and supplier of scientific goods. This website is designed to enhance Alpha Sudarshan Chemicals' online presence and provide users with a seamless experience.

## Project Overview

I designed and developed this website with a focus on creating a highly responsive and fast platform. To achieve this, I implemented key concepts such as lazy loading and DNS prefetching. These optimizations contribute to a smoother user experience, ensuring that visitors can access information quickly and efficiently.

## Hosting and Continuous Deployment

The website is hosted using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), an AWS hosting service tailored for Node-based web applications. This platform enables automatic updates to the website whenever changes are pushed to this Git repository.

You can access the live website [here](https://www.alphasudarshan.in). Feel free to explore and provide feedback!

## Tech Stack

The website is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience.
- JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React to describe what the UI should look like.
- json-server: A simple and lightweight JSON-based REST API server for development purposes.
- AWS (Amplify, S3, CloudFront, Route53): Leveraging Amazon Web Services for hosting, content delivery, and domain management.
